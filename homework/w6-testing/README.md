Hey all, I got a little confused this week. I've been trying to build more complex logic, but yeh na, nothing I tried worked.

I thought to make a search service, that could list the designers by location or skills. I tried implementing a search model/service/route to handle those requests, but couldn't get the routing right. so I moved the methods back to the designer service :/  

Also I plan to change my customer model to be user. and yeah like I said above, the user should be able to request the designers by location or skill. 

My goal is to eventually incorporate a map that will show the density of female designers around the world. I would like it if you can click through that, and pull up lists by location and skill, and from there click through to the designers websites :)  

thanks for listening, any advice/resources are much appreciated. here is the code the I managed to get working so far...  

See you Tuesday! <3
